# MobileNet-CNN-Car-Detection-Safety-Evaluation-
In this project, I used a pre-trained version of MobileNet and assessed its car detection accuracy in 2 scenarios, moving and static frames. The tasks included preprocessing frames, applying MobileNet and analysis of predicted class labels with an accuracy metric.
